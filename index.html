<pre>
    He was born in San Francisco(January 03, 1929) and he found one of the biggest company in computer world.
His high education began with Berkeley and continued with California Institute of Technology.Later he 
started postdoctoral research in Applied Physics Laboratory.He finished education life in Johns Hopkins 
University.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Moore">[1]</a> 

    He worked as tecnical staff in Applied Physics Laboratory at John Hopkins University. William Shockley 
who is co-inventor of the transistor worked with him in 1956.They started works Shockley Semiconductor 
Laboratory in California.[<a href="http://www.computer.org/web/awards/goode-moore-noyce">3</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Moore">1</a>]

    In 1968, Intel Corporation which is the largest computer processor producer was established.They began with
 semiconductar memories, then the first microprocessor was established by Gordon Moore and Intel Corporation.[<a href="http://www.computer.org/web/awards/goode-moore-noyce">3</a>]

    When Moore was working at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1965, he found a predict.According to this prediction the 
number of components in processor will increase double every years.Ten years later, he changed predict.As that
 predict number of transistor will increase double every two years.That estimation was created Moore's law.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Moore">[1]</a>]

    Moore served Intel as executive vice president, chairman of the board and CEO.Computer's brain which we use 
now was invented by him.Processors are devoloping every day with his company.That means this man created important
 part of the computer technology.[<a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/gordon-moore/">5</a>]
