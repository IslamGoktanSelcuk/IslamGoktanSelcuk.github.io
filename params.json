William Shockley \r\nwho is co-inventor of the transistor worked with him in 1956.They started works Shockley Semiconductor \r\nLaboratory in California.[<a href=\"http://www.computer.org/web/awards/goode-moore-noyce\">3</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Moore\">1</a>]\r\n<img src=\"http://www.computer.org/cms/Awards/images/medium/robertnoyce-gd.jpg\" alt=\"Moore\" style=\"width:135px;height:145px;\">\r\n<b><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Moore\">Figure 1[4]</a></b>\r\n\r\n    In 1968, Intel Corporation which is the largest computer processor producer was established.They began with\r\n semiconductar memories, then the first microprocessor was established by Gordon Moore and Intel Corporation.[<a href=\"http://www.computer.org/web/awards/goode-moore-noyce\">3</a>]\r\n\r\n    When Moore was working at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1965, he found a predict.According to this prediction the \r\nnumber of components in processor will increase double every years.Ten years later, he changed predict.As that\r\n predict number of transistor will increase double every two years.That estimation was created Moore's law.[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Moore\">[1]</a>]\r\n<img src=\"http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/images/photography/history-moore-moores-law-graphic-3-1.jpg\" alt=\"Intel\" style=\"width:380px;height:140px;\">\r\n<b><a href=\"http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/images/photography/history-moore-moores-law-graphic-3-1.jpg\">Figure 2[2]</a></b>    \r\n    \r\n    Moore served Intel as executive vice president, chairman of the board and CEO.Computer's brain which we use \r\nnow was invented by him.Processors are devoloping every day with his company.That means this man created important\r\n part of the computer technology.[<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/gordon-moore/\">5</a>] \r\n\r\n\r\nIslam Göktan SELCUK 141044071 -- BIL 101 HW 1\r\n<hr>\r\n28 September 2015\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align:center\">References</h2>\r\n<pre style=\"text-align:center\">\r\n    <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Moore\">1.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Moore</a>\r\n    <a href=\"http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/images/photography/history-moore-moores-law-graphic-3-1.jpg\">2.http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/images/photography/history-moore-moores-law-graphic-3-1.jpg</a>\r\n    <a href=\"http://www.computer.org/web/awards/goode-moore-noyce\">3.http://www.computer.org/web/awards/goode-moore-noyce</a>\r\n    <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Moore\">4.http://www.computer.org/cms/Awards/images/medium/robertnoyce-gd.jpg</a>\r\n    <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/gordon-moore/\">5.http://www.forbes.com/profile/gordon-moore/</a>\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<body>\r\n</html>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
